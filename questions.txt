1. What is faster to find an answer given the same graph, same start node, and same goal node: breadth-first search, depth-first search, or "it depends"? Explain why.

2. What is the worst case (Big-O) runtime of breadth-first search? Explain why.

3. Why would an adjacency matrix be less memory efficient than an adjacency list for storing a social graph of friends, like part of Facebook?

4. Give an example of depth-first search in the real world (not on a computer).
